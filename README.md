# CS2610 Assignment 3 - Interactive JavaScript Calculator

Original Repository was created by Erik Falor at 
git@gitlab.cs.usu.edu:erik.falor/cs2610-falor-erik-assn3.git.

As a heads-up to the grader; I have only tested this application on 
Google Chrome, so if you test it using any other browser; I make no 
promises that it will work...

## Create a webpage using as little HTML as possible

In order to give me better real-world experience with git, I began by
taking up an incomplete project. My first priority was to study this code to
understand how it was organized, to learn what features are already provided,
and find where to add the new code to satisfy the requirements set forth on
Canvas. It was up to me to _read the code_ and understand what all of it was
doing.

for complete assignment instructions.
